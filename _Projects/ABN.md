## Company Introduction

African Bridge Network (ABN) in Massachusetts is an organization focused on supporting African immigrants as they integrate into the American workforce. ABN was created to address the challenges many African immigrants face in translating their foreign education, professional skills, and experiences into the U.S. job market.


## My work with ABN

I worked with Emmanuel, the founder of ABN, and Maddy, the Communication Manager over a period of two months on this marketing analytics project. 

ABN wanted to expand its brand awareness in primarily the Massachusetts area, but also looking into other regions in the US as well.

The work I did for ABN includes:

- An initial set of Google Analytics reports that can be used to track key metrics about the
organizationâ€™s web performance and insights on visitors' interest.
- Training on how to create and maintain reports and analyse collected data to inform changes to the organization's web presence.
- Optimize Keyword search for the ABN website for  SEO purposes.

## Project Overview
The project duration was two months, and I had an 1-hour meeting with ABN everyweek to go over
the progree over the past week. 
I've divided the project into following stages:
- Gathering data and requirement
- Understand Data and business requirements
- Data Visualization
- Marketing Strategies based on analytics finding

1: Gathering data and requirement<br>
At the beginning of the project, ABN only required me to work with their website data, and they had set up Google Analytics, so I predominately worked with Google Analytics to gather all the data I need to accomplish the project. 
Based on the meetings I had with ABN, I drafted a list of metrics I would include in the final deliverables:

2:Understand Data and business requirements<br>
After finishing the requirement, I started creating a dashboard, through connecting the data from Google Analytics to Google Data Studio.
