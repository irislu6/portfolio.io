<h1> IT Internship at Viatris</h1>

## Background

### Company intro
Viatris is a global pharmaceutical company that was formed through a merger between Mylan N.V. and Upjohn, a division of Pfizer Inc. The company is headquartered in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, in the United States, and it operates in more than 165 countries worldwide. Viatris is a major player in the pharmaceutical industry, with a diverse portfolio that includes generic medications, biosimilars, and certain brand-name drugs.

## My Internship Experience


I spent the summer of 2023 working as an IT intern at the manufacturing R&D department at Viatris.  My job duties had a mix of both information technology and pharmaceutical manufacturing aspects. My work involves the follow aspects:

### Automation 

One of the largest project I took on was to program a product recipe in MES (Manufacturing execution system). Based on the documents from R&D team, my project was able to contribute to the automation of manufacturing and laboratory processes, including the development and testing of software scripts or programs to improve efficiency and accuracy. Over the two weeks working this project, I learned how to work with MES system, get more familiar with the GMP regulation, particularly in pharmaceutical manufacturing spaces. And was able to assist the automation engineer was system testings.

### Data Management

- Data Visualization

I worked with the manufacturing analytics team on designing data visualization in Power BI for tracking lab testing. My work helped manage and analyze large datasets from LIMS during pharmaceutical manufacturing and testing processes. Through data cleansing, data integration and data visualization tasks, I translated the QA team’s requirement into executable functions in a PowerBI reporting suite. The dashboard I created automates weekly reports, helping the QA team to track testing schedules and has reduced their manual data entry workload every week up to 4 hours.

- Database Management

Since all the batch records ran through MES would generate a series of data related to the manufacturing process in the MES database, since the team uses an outside vendor’s database services, we don’t have full control over the schema design of the database at first place. The manufacturing site hoped to see the potency rate that’s related to each executed batch record, which could help track accuracy rate.

I worked with the other intern on my team, using SQL queries trying to create a view with batch ID, executed date, product description and potency rate. The challenge in this project being the current database has a complicated table relationship with the data we wanted the retrieve scattered over dozens of tables. We learned how to retreive data through querying the metadata on a data source.

**Project Management**  
The first project I took on was to create a user requirement documents for validation work related to Data Historian. I drafted a project scope based on clients, which was the Quality Testing team, and translated their need into accomplishable technical scope.

## Takeaway

### Collaboration
Collaborate with R&D scientists and engineers to understand their IT needs and provide technical support and solutions to optimize their workflow.

I had the chance to work with cross functional teams globally. I communicated with team in Europe and India during my project about creating a reporting suite using LIMS data to study manufacturing quality rate. Since the company uses the same format for the dashboard for all manufacturing sites all over the World, I joined a weekly meeting with global analytics teams, to share my site’s manufacturing requirements, and discuss what functions can be used to achieve those requirements. I served as a subject matter lead in those weekly meetings with teams from other manufacturing sites across the world, and the global analytics team. We collaborated on creating the reporting suite in PowerBI using LIMS data to track manufacturing’s quality testing rate. I was also responsible for presenting the IT projects my team worked on with the global team of 40 staff.

### Experience in Healthcare/Biopharma industry

Overall my experience at Viatris was extremely valuable for me, as it provided me an opportunity to work with a team of experienced IT professionals. My team consisted of 5 people who are specialized in different areas of IT such as infrastructure, automation, and operation IT.
<br>I was able to see how IT works in pharmaceutical industry, help company to increase manufacturing efficiency, and through this journey I was very lucky to gain insight into the biopharam manufacturing industry which is a field that's compeletely new to me.
