Hi! I'm Iris. I am currently a graduate student studying Management Information Systems at NYU. 
<br>On this website you can find my data analytics projects, and posts on my previous work experiences. 

<br>I came from a background in Marketing where I worked in digital marketing, SEO, and sales. I decided to get my masters degree in MIS since
I realized that technical skills like data analytics can better help business grow and understand their customers. 


<br>Let's connect on  [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xinhuiirislu/)!
