>My professional journey has encompassed a range of enriching experiences. During my recent IT internship at
Viatris, I had the opportunity to program new recipes in Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES) for healthcare
product automation. I successfully managed the project from conception to system testing, resulting in the
successful launch of two new healthcare products in the US market.


My skill set extends to software proficiency in Microsoft Office, Google Sheets, Tableau, MySQL, Oracle
